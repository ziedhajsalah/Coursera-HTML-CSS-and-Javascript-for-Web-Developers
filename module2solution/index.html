                        in the desktop view (992px and above), each of
                        the 3 sections should take up equal amount of
                        space on the screen. As you make the browser
                        window wider or narrower, each section should
                        become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages
                        to define width and use the ‘float’ property.
                        See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this
                        view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.

                        in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd
                        section should be in the second row and take up
